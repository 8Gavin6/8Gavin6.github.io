        In the 20th century snooker, there was a particular focus on the sport. The atmosphere at each tournament was particularly exciting. Both the billiard players and the spectators are very enjoyable. Because each shot to solve the ball, positioning, etc. need a lot of practice. It also takes into account the physical and mental state of the player at the time. There are many unknowns and uncertainties in every game. This is the charm of the snooker game.
