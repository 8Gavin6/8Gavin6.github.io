            He has a great scoring ability (often 80+ in a single shot), a long pot success rate with high accuracy, and has made 901 single shots and 7 perfect scores (147) as of 2022. He is the world's third-best scorer (Ronnie O'Sullivan's 1,107 and John Higgins' 900), and they are the only three snooker players to have 800+ career bogeys at the 2021 World Championship.

He is a serial scorer, who set the world record for "100+ in a single season" with 102 in 19-20, and is second in the world with 90 in 20-21, a record (90+ centuries in a single season) that no player on the Conference roster has yet achieved. The record (90+ centuries in a season) has not yet been achieved by any player on the Conference roster.

He enjoyed unprecedented success in junior tournaments before turning professional in 2005. He won his first ranking title on March 11, 2011 when he defeated Mark Selby 10-8 in the final of the China Open. He was then beaten by John Higgins in the final of the World Championship, finishing as runner-up. At the end of the year, he defeated Allen 10-8 in the final of the British Championship to win that year's event.

Before his current No. 1 ranking, he briefly reached No. 1 in the world rankings for the first time in November 2012 after winning the International Championship. But the following year, he was overtaken again by Mark Selby, Neil Robertson and Ronnie O'Sullivan and fell out of the world number one ranking.

Trump is known for his strong power, sharp shots and high drop rate, often hitting a number of show shots in his winning matches after breaking 100. With his quick thinking, fast shots, aggressive style of play and energetic appearance, he became a huge hit when he first started, and was loved by fans as a new hope in the world [5], and was once named by Ronnie O'Sullivan as his "successor".
